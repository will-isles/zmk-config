Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

This library uses ZMK Firmware. Its context7CompatibleLibraryID is `/zmkfirmware/zmk`
